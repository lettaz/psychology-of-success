This may sound like an obvious thing to state but psychology is a subject which is often misunderstood and referred to without any real consideration as to its actual meaning. A classic case in point being the usual response you get from people when you tell them that you teach psychology; namely, &quot;I better be careful what I say&quot;, or &quot;so do you know what I'm thinking then?&quot;
Confusion over the meaning of psychology is not restricted to members of the public. When I first started my research,i found out that many don't fully understand the concept of psychology,not to talk of its relations to abstract things of life.For this chapter we would be going through;"

                android:text="To help understand the ambiguity surrounding psychology, let's start by taking a look at a couple of definitions.
&quot;Psychology is the scientific study of people, the mind and behavior. It is both a thriving academic discipline and a vital professional practice.&quot;(Brittish psychological society)
&quot;The scientific study of the behavior of individuals and their mental processes.&quot;(American Psychological Association)
If you notice, you discover that both of these definitions tell us that psychology is fundamentally concerned with understanding behavior.
Personally i think psychology is most important amongst all field, due to its applicability, it is about us,the most important and intimate aspects of our life, Our perceptions, Our dreams, love, hate, morality. It is about our sense of right and wrong.
Especially when you're beginning. Simply keep hold of the thought that Psychology is fundamentally about conduct. You can't be relied upon to know all the diverse routes there are to clarify conduct straight away; however as you are acquainted with more you'll see that you'll before long have the capacity to put a social clarification inside a proper mental structure.
Most think of psychology as mental illness,counselling,clinicians but its far from that,psychology deals with MENTALITY not MENTAL ILLNESS, don't get it twisted.
When we say Mentality,i.e how our thought affects our actions and state, how it affects everything around us and that is particularly what psychology is concerned about.
Now this takes us to the next sub-heading, psychology's relationship with success.
How dies our behavioral instincts affect our success in life?&#xD;
What role does our mentality have to play, in pushing us to success?&#xD;"

The psychology  of success is regularly disregarded completely. While truly, hard work is part of the equation, they are missing a large part. You can never wind up successful if you don't correct mentality.
The correct attitude/mentality  fixes everything. Your mentality will decide whether you're effective/successful or in case you're unsuccessful. Your mindset  will reveal to you that you're a disappointment and you should simply surrender or that you're in good shape to progress. Which voice would you say you are listening as well?
Becoming an entrepreneur will be the hardest challenge of your life because you're becoming a different person than everyone else. When that happens, you will question yourself. Are you on the right path? Why don't you just work for someone else? If you continue to ask yourself these questions, you will lose. When you have the right mindset, no matter what you face, you will come out the other side.

Melyssa's  mindset changed when she realized that telling herself she couldn't do something would not work out. If she wanted to get to the next level in her life, she knew that even if she didn't know how to do something; she was going to figure it out no matter how long it would take her.
There are so many ways you can learn something in today's day and age that telling yourself you can't do something is ludicrous. If you want to make six-figures, do your research on how others made six-figures. What habits are they doing different from the ones you have? How do they plan their day? What type of work are they doing? The answer to every question is there if you're willing to do the research. Just because you don't know how to do something shouldn't hold you back from achieving whatever you set your mind too.
Being an entrepreneur, Melyssa realized there are tons of negative events that can take place. To counteract the negative events, Melyssa would take to gratitude journal, writing the positive events taking place in her life. What you're essentially doing is creating a positive perspective view of the world for yourself.
Psychology of success entails HOW to do,WHEN to do, WHERE you will do it, WHAT to do and the level of effort to be applied that propels you to success.

Relating to success, If we take the FEAR as SUCCESS  and the WHITE RAT as IMPACT,while THE THINGS YOU DO TO MAKE IMPACT as the loud,clanging sounds.
You see that IMPACT tends to follow success, so far it has passed through conditioning,i.e right things done to make impact.

From the example in classical conditioning, we can see that they had to pair voice with the rat, so as to stimulate fear in little albert, but if make analysis, albert would not fear the rate on the first trial, they would done it about two to three times to incure fear, so as to register in alberts mind that the white rat comes with that voice.
Now looking at it from success angle, it is not on your first trial of making impact that you become successful, you need to continue solving problems and making impact, continue steadfastly in that which you do to make impact, till success finally learns to follow your impacts.
