Then he bought a generator, which powered only two rooms leaving the last room dark. Then his wife bought a torch, but was only using this torch for the rooms with light. You would say she is not okay right?&#xD;
But this scenario has been the problem of many youths and soon to be entrepreneurs. They look for solution for a problem that has already been solved instead of either finding a new problem that can be solved or look for loop holes in the solution.&#xD;
Amaizu Melody said, &quot;Entrepreneurship is not mathematics, you don't get the same answer for one question.&quot;&#xD;
In entrepreneurship one problem can yield different solution dependent on the solution of the other. This brings us to the theory of Light and darkness has it relates to success.&#xD;
From the story above, lets take the man and his wife has two entrepreneurs, and the generator has a problem solved by the man then the torch has another solution, then the darkness as the problem.&#xD;
Theory says, &quot;Of what essence is light in a place that has been fully lightened.&quot;"

Then the wife (another entrepreneur) brought a solution, but her solution was for a problem that has been solved, forgetting that there is still a problem even in the solution made by the man,which was the last room.&#xD;
If the wife had used the torch in the last room, there should be light in the full house or better still bring a device that would power the full house (including the last room).&#xD;
In essence, are you seeking for an idea, planning a start up? Do not use torch light or light providing device in a place where there is already light. I.e do not seek for solution in a place where there is solution, but rather look for loop holes in the already solved problem, or find a solution to another problem entirely.&#xD;
Theory of light and darkness is majorly concerned with the opportunity mindset of entrepreneurs, their ability to be able to detect opportunities from far sight, be able to use the available to do the impossible.&#xD;"

People often wait for opportunities, but is it worth waiting for opportunities? My answer? No, it isn't.&#xD;
First of all you can't depend on pure luck, you never know if  you will be granted with a great opportunity or not. So why do you want to be dependent on luck? Instead you could be and should be dependent on yourself. This is the only sure way you know you will be granted with an opportunity.&#xD;
Opportunities are missed by most people because they don't realise they've encountered such.  Here is one of those basic laws in life: There will always be opportunities for those who recognise and pursue them. The lucky people are simply those who have taken more chances than average.&#xD;
Why Wait For The Opportunity? Create Opportunities By Yourself!&#xD;

But he didn't think so; He knew he could create a successful blog himself and that all happened. And in the end he did. Now he is earning x5 more than what his friends are earning. He works from home, He works when he  wants to and The best is that. He is doing something meaningful; He is helping people and I love that. He  wasn't afraid to go out of the box.
