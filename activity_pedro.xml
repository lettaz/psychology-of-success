Birth of BellaNaija.com
Uche started blogging as a hobby, using it as a means of keeping herself busy while waiting to resume her post graduate job with Shell. She founded BellaNaija in July 2006 and went on to establish Bainstone Limited in 2009. The idea for starting up BellaNaija.com came to her while she was still studying as an undergraduate at University of Western Ontario, Canada. She has always loved Nigeria and Africa and would visit whenever she had a break either at school or at work. Each time she visited Nigeria, she heard and saw how everything in Nigeria was growing, the fashion industry becoming more vibrant, entertainment industry booming, young people getting involved in politics, birth of new businesses by young entrepreneurs and so on. It was so encouraging to her so she decided to start something that will represent the new exciting vibe in the country. And so she began to blog about fashion and celebrities in Nigeria, she started by scanning magazine articles, pictures and interviews of Nigerian fashion personalities, and that was how her website BellaNaija.com was initiated. She was blogging in a low profile way as a hobby until her BellaNaija site began to expand having over one million visitors every month. At that point, she then revealed the personality behind BellaNaija.com to the media.
BellaNaija started on a free platform (www.bellanaija.blogspot.com) on the 1st of July 2006 before moving to bellanaija.com. When the site starting hitting millions in views in a month, Uche realised the potential of what she was building and she went ahead to organise the business.
